# transpiler

> An attempt at a small transpiler - converts to JavaScript

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rayzr522/transpiler.git
```

## Usage

There is currently no official API and very little syntax support, but you can run `demo.js` to test the transpiler. The debug output is quite verbose, which may be interesting to look through.

```bash
node demo.js
```

Alternatively, you can pass code to run through the transpiler as a parameter to the command:

```bash
node demo.js 'x = you_are( "incredible" "k?" ); y = 3'
```
